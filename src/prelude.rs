//! Convenience re-export of common items
//! 
//! This prelude only contains features that are fully implemented.
//! Notably, items from [scales][crate::scales] and [chord][crate::chord] aren't present, since they are WIP.
//! 
//! The contents of this prelude must be imported manually:
//!
//! ```
//! use music_theory::prelude::*;
//! # let _ = Pitch::C;
//! ```
